# The Game #

The domino game consists of 28 dominos, Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends, each end is marked with a number of spots or is blank.
actually there are other sets of dominos, but we are going to use the "Double Six" set which consists of 28 dominos having 168 spots (also known as "pips")

# Rules: #

Most domino games are blocking games, the objective is to empty one's hand whilst blocking the opponents. In the end, a score may be determined by counting the pips in the losing players' hands.
Dominos are shuffled face down and each player choose seven dominos. the remainder is not used in the game.
each player looks if he has "double six" domino, (6,6) if not they look for double five, until they reach to double zero, if no doubles exist, they can play any domino instead, and that is our first player to put the first domino on the floor.
the second player looks for a domino that matches any square of the dominos on the floor, if he find any, he should put it, if not he should pass. (let's say he found a matching number)
now we have two dominos on the floor, it's the first player turn again, he should not play on the already-busy squares.
this means that he has two choices, one square of the first domino, and one square of the second.
unless he finds a double-numbered domino, which can be used on four sides.
the game goes on until both players don't have matching numbers, or one of them finishes his dominos, and that is our winner.
