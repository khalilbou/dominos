# Open Source & GPL #

**Our** project will be Open Source -as expected- and licensed under GPL (GNU General Public License).
to get advantage of the open source developers over the world


## Let us talk about GPL. ##

The principle of copyright is very simple: When an author creates a unique piece of work, such as a computer program, then he is the owner of all rights to that piece of work. He may decide what others can and cannot do with it. What others may do with that piece of work is usually written down in a License Statement, a contract between the creator and the user which describes the rights that the user has. These rights may be granted for free, but in most cases the user has to pay for them. A typical license in the world of computer software entitles the user to run the binary program on the number of machines that the license was purchased for. It is not allowed to make more copies of the software than needed for running it, and one extra backup copy. Furthermore, the user cannot claim any rights to the source code and is not allowed to dissemble the binary code to learn and/or alter its inner workings. In short, a typical copyright statement does not give you the right to copy. In contrast, the GNU General Public License or GPL for short, turns this around. The aim of the GPL is to keep all software “free”, so that everybody can adapt the software to its own needs, without being dependent on the goodwill of the author. This means that any piece of software that has been placed under the GPL by the original author gives the user the following rights: • The user may copy the (binary) software as often as he or she wishes. • The user has the right to obtain the source code. • The user has the right to alter the source code and recompile the source code into binary form. • The user may distribute the sources and the binaries. • The user may charge money for all of this. Basically the only restriction that the GPL imposes on all users is that the license statement may not be changed. This means that all your customers have the same rights to the software as you do. And as a practical aside, that means that in general it is impossible to make any money from selling the software (apart from a nominal fee for media and distribution). The GPL is the most-often used license statement in the Linux world, but other open source licenses, such as the BSD license, are also being used.

## Effects of the GPL LICENSE ##

### Everybody has access to the source. ###
. Volunteer software development on the Internet, with central coordination.

. Linus Torvalds coordinates kernel development .

.Others coordinate other pieces of the OS.

### Peer reviews possible. ###
. Security.

. Performance.
### License cannot change. ###
. So your changes (and name) will stay in forever
